# Contributing


Absolutely! 

[I](mailto:sebjacobvfx@gmail.com), developed this while commuting to work to :
 
 - practice c++ coding
 - get familiar with the NDK and how Nuke fundamentally operates

Would love to see this project grow and be expanded with the help of others.

    * artists : likes and dislikes, bugs feature requests ?
    * c++ coders : Any constructive criticism or PR welcome.
    * python gurus : making the c++ core accessible in python would be of interest.
    * anyone with a knowledge of cmake cross compiling : would be nice to consolidate the multiple platforms
    for easier delivery.
